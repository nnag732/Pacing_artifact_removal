-The script creates a sample data matrix using the sampleData.mat and add pacing artifacts
-The added artifacts are detected using a Hampel filter and reconstructed using autoregression, weighted means and linear interpolation
-The signals reconstructed using the 3 methods are visualized on top of the original trace and displayed at the end
